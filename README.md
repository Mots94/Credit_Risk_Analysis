# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Determining the risk of granting a loan can be a challenging task for many reasons.  One of those reasons is that there is much more data related to good loans as opposed to bad loans.  If a machine learning model needs to accurately predict a risky loan decision, not having as much data on bad loan decisions makes it difficult to teach the model what features are most often predict a bad loan.  However, there are algorithms that can be used to resample target variable data, which may aid in creating a model that more accurately predicts risky loans.  Six algorithms which either resampled data reduced data bias were evaluated to determine if any of them could predict risky loan outcomes.

## Results
* The first model utilized a simple naive random oversampling approach
